Please note:

after you have updated your MongoDB document, some previous migrations scripts might not compile anymore. -Usually you would delete them, since they serve no purpose anymore. I, however, did not delete them so you see the history of changes.-
Please try to create migration-scripts without relying on the document, since changes to a document might break your migration-"scripts".
